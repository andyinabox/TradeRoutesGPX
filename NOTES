Planning to reference Dave Shea's Elevation to fig. out 3D stuff:

https://github.com/mezzoblue/Elevation

It's written as an application, and currently doesn't work for me if I try to 
run it as a sketch (why?) but if I export as application it does. Kind of
messy but I think I could learn from it.
