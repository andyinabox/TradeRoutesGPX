Trade Routes GPX
================

An experiment with Processing, Arduino, and GPX data. I'm looking at ways of analyzing GPX data taken with a GPS app on my iPhone, as well as getting more familiar with how Arduino & Processing work.

Goals:
------

* Display (very) simple graph of elevation data in Processing
* Play back elevation data on Arduino 5-LED array
* Control speed of elevation data playback using potentiometer attached to Arduino.
* More developed 2D display of elevation data in Processing, draw graph as loop.
* Show "MPH" based on playback speed and geo data.
* 3D display of GPX data.

This is, by definition, a work in progress.
